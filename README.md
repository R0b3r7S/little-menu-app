A little cute app written in C

• Changes in the names of variables and functions from HR to EN.
• CamelCase is used for variable names.
• PascalCase is used for function names.
• Regarding the selection of naming which is for C in snake_case I wanted to add to the old language a slightly fresher touch that is normally used in OOP language.
• Organized source code into multiple files.
• If an action is selected that involves a previously performed action, and the previous action was not performed, the program will not crash, but will give the user feedback.
