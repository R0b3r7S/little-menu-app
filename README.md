# little-menu-app
A little cute app written in C.

What does the application do? Essentially it has limited student data, it adds them to a “local database” represented by a binary file, reads them, prints them, deletes them. It is possible to rename the binary file as well as delete it, the rest are small things.
What to say for the end, the application always has room for changes. 

• Changes in the names of variables and functions from HR to EN

• camelCase is used for variable names

• PascalCase is used for function names

• Regarding the selection of naming which is for C in snake_case I wanted to add to the old language a slightly fresher touch that is normally used in OOP language

• Organized source code into multiple files

• If an action is selected that involves a previously performed action, and the previous action was not performed, the program will not crash, but will give the user feedback

-> Soon a new feature, student updates in binary file.
